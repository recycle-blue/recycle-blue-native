Recycle Blue is a social network and marketplace application that is designed to incentivize users to recycle more.
This is achieved by gamifying the activity of recycling by using a points and milestones system.

### Using RecycleBlue 

Users can document their recycling activities by pressing the + button located on the top right of the screen.
This will activate the phone's camera and the user can take a picture of their recycling activity.
Recycle Blue uses AI tagging services to classify user Images and then assigns points to the user based on how recyclable their item is.  User's can view their Recycling activity on their user dashboard as well as view their weekly recycling activity and their progress towards their next milestone. User's can share their activities to other social media platforms as well as view a feed of all their friends' recent activities.

### The Market Place
Users can peruse a market place to see what reusable items are being offered up by other users. They can view what items are being offered near them by viewing the map or they can see a list of all the items on offer by going to the ads page. If a user is interested in a particular item they can email the owner of the ad to claim the item. Users can then use their favorite navigation app to find a route to the item they would like to claim .The aim of the market place is to encourage the reuse of otherwise non-recyclable items as well as to help businesses that recycle heavy duty items like refrigerators find those particular items.

### Cross Compatibility
Our mission is to get as many people to document and share their recycling activities. We built RecycleBlue for Andriod and IOS so that no one would be left out.
